# Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

Nothing to implement here, you're just watching videos and taking notes! Yay!
There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review.
Don't worry if you don't understand all the math behind it.
You just need to understand how to express the complexity of an algorithm in terms of Big-O.
